**Introduction to Theory and Unity of All Things**  
  
Our purpose here is not to write a textbook on physics, but rather to present this theory in its simplest form, so it may be understood by layman and physicist alike. We will make no attempt to appease the scientific community in this presentation, as we know from long experience that they will reject the evidence of their own eyes, if that evidence should challenge what they have accepted as physical "law". In other words then, this paper will simply explain what is happening in our physical world and why. All of the mathematical calculations that go with the theory will be left for another, more appropriate time.  
  
We will begin this discussion by stating that the force which unifies all things is motion, for without motion there is nothing, and we will then show the dynamics of a body in motion (falling body). From there we will enter into brief discussions on energy to mass conversion, mass to energy conversion, anti-matter, and will summarize with a short explanation of the equation which unifies all things, i.e., mass, energy and forces.  
  
It is not an easy task to relearn physics, we know, but this theory has been tested and is correct, so it is well worth the effort to study this material carefully. If what is being said is comprehended, the reader should be able to begin to apply the information to the earth in general, and to what is happening to the ionosphere in particular. Once atomic structure has been explained, the reader will also begin to see how, using technologies based on correct physics, we can repair the damage and place this planet back into its proper balance - if we work together.  
  
# [UNITY OF ALL THINGS](#unity-of-all-things) {#unity-of-all-things}
  
**THEORY**  
  
We have already stated that motion is the catalyst by which all else exists. For this reason we refer to motion as the creative force. We will now further state that the four forces that have been identified by the scientific community are in reality one force in four of its different actions. This force manifests itself in different actions based on predictable conditions and its stage in a repetitious, wonderfully simple cycle called nature. Currently due to the work of Fischbach and Aronson, the scientific community is speculating that perhaps all bodies do not accelerate at the same rate, but instead of backing up and questioning existing "law", these scientists are now busy hypothesizing that there is yet another force, which they have tentatively named hypercharge. We know this is not correct! What they have stumbled upon is in fact no more than the unified force displaying its repulsive action. Our generic term for the unified force is neutral energy, and we will now attempt to show how it manifests itself in the physical world.  
  
# [FALLING BODIES](#falling-bodies) {#falling-bodies}
  
For the purposes of this paper, the term falling body is defined as any body which moves, or "falls" through a gravitational field. This includes all sub-atomic particles, solar systems, galaxies, universes, universal vortexes, and yet greater expanses. As indicated in our tests and illustrated below, a falling body produces about itself a force of extracted energy.  
  

![A circle is in the middle. Many oval shapes radiate outward from the centre outwards. At the outward end of each oval an arrow points further away from the centre of the circle. Each respective oval has two small arrows drawn on it, one up and one down. Indicating the oval is a flow going round in an elliptical shape. Some of the ovals have one edge near the centre of the circle, others have the closest edge already outside the circle.](/img/fig14.jpg)
[Fig. 14](#fig14) {#fig14}
  
This extracted energy attempts to return to the body it's been extracted from. As shown in figure 14, this cycle produces a force around the body. The result is a gravitational field which will be felt as an attracting force by anything which exists within that field. As the arrows indicate, however, any body or thing which exists outside of this field will be pushed away (or repulsed) from the body. It must be understood - that which is generically referred to as gravity is __not always__ an attracting force.  
  
The major line of extraction of energy from a falling body is at the leading edge of the fall of that body, as illustrated in figure 15.  
  

![diagram note says: “Energy is extracted at the leading edge of the fall”
On the right hand side is an arrow pointing down, saying “Direction of fall”. 
In the centre of the diagram is a circle with a dot in the middle. Extending from the circle outwards are oval shapes, with an arrow at the farthest edge pointing away from the circle. The angle of the ovals are approx. 90 degrees to the point of escape from the circle. On one oval there is another arrow aligned with the oval, but pointing toward the circle.
](./img/fig15.jpg)
[Fig. 15](#fig15) {#fig15}
  
As has been indicated, the extracted energy attempts to return to the body it has been extracted from, however, motion at the rate of velocity squared will not allow this energy to return to the body. This pressure or "pull" is felt by the body, causing it to rotate in the direction of the energy extraction, as shown below.  
  

![On the right hand side of the diagram is an arrow pointing down, saying “Direction of fall”. 
In the centre of the diagram is a circle with a dot in the middle. Extending from the circle outwards are oval shapes, with an arrow at the farthest edge pointing away from the circle. The angle of the ovals are approx. 90 degrees to the point of escape from the circle. Inside the circle is an arrow showing the circle is rotating counterclockwise.
](./img/fig16.jpg)
[Fig. 16](#fig16) {#fig16}
  
Size, velocity, composition of the body, and the value of the gravitational field the body falls through are all major factors in the rate of the rotation. For instance, the larger the body, the faster the rotation, and the greater the velocity of the body the faster it will rotate. Also, a falling body composed of steel will rotate faster than an equal sized body of carbon, the reasons for which will be discussed in greater depth in the segment on atomic structure.  


As previously explained, the energy extracted from a falling body at all times attempts to return to the body, which in turn produces a gravitational field. Therefore, any and all bodies which come into contact with the force of the falling body in question will be and are attracted to the body as seen below.

![same as fig 15 & 16: a circle with ovals extending outwards. An arrow inside the smallest circle indicates it is rotating counterclockwise.
Three additional concentric circles are drawn further away from the original circle. They are marked: “Force field”. Additionally there are 5 black dots spread around the force field concentric circles, each with a short arrow pointing toward the centre of the circle.](./img/fig17.jpg)
[Fig. 17](#fig17) {#fig17}

Keep in mind that these smaller bodies are also falling bodies and so have produced their own fields of extracted energy. This means that even as these bodies are attracted to the larger body in whose field they exist, they are simultaneously repulsed from that body, due to the repulsive action of their own field. This interaction between the attractive and repulsive actions of the fields of both bodies will reach an equilibrium point which is commonly known as an orbit.

  
The energy that's been extracted from the leading edge of a falling body presents an energy void to the body. This energy void is filled by an input of energy 90° from the leading edge of the falling body, as illustrated in figure 18.  
  

![On the right hand side is an arrow pointing down, saying “Direction of fall”.
a large circle is drawn. There are 8 arrows pointing towards the circle and entering it, at roughly: 12 clock, 1:30, 3 o'clock, etc. Spread even all the way around the circle. There are 7 arrows pointing away from the circle starting at the surface, mixed in between the original inward arrows. Their angle of egress is roughly 45 degrees.
A side note with an arrow points at the circle: “Energy extracted at the leading edge results in an energy void to the body”. At the bottom of the diagram it says: “The energy void results in energy flow into the body”](./img/fig18.jpg)
[Fig. 18](#fig18) {#fig18}
  
This input energy taken in at the point of rotation (90° from the leading edge) is what is seen as the magnetic poles, indicated below.  
  

![Diagram label: “Direction of Fall is toward the LEFT.”
In the centre is a large circle. At the top and bottom appear “plumes of arrows” pointing inwards. The area where the arrows enter is marked: “pole area”. On the left side of the circle is an arrow pointing to the circle: “leading edge”. A procession of three thin ovals marches across the circle's equator, from left to right.The three ovals have arrows extending from the far right edges, pointing right. The arrows point approximately (if North is 0 degrees and South is 180 degrees) toward respectively 45, 90 and 120 degrees.
](./img/fig19.jpg)
[Fig. 19](#fig19) {#fig19}
  
The energy flow into the poles, combined with the extraction of energy at the leading edge of the fall, produces an energy flow which results in a magnetic field, as seen in figure 20.  
  

![Diagram label: “Direction of Fall is toward the LEFT.”
Above that label, in the centre of the diagram, is a large circle. Across the circle are four ovals with their edges pointing to the RIGHT, approx towards (if North is 0 degrees and South is 180 degrees) toward respectively 50, 90, 120 degrees. The ovals are labelled “extracted energy”. Near the top of the circle, at roughly 355 degrees and 5 degrees, numerous lines flow outwards and make a loop down, around the circle, and point back in at the (approx 185 and 175 degrees mark. 
The lines starting at roughly 355 degrees loop left, down, around and back up towards the 180 point of the circle.
The lines starting at roughly 5 degrees loop right, down, around and back up towards the 180 point of the circle.
The “flow loops” are labelled “magnetic field”. At approx 0 and 180 degrees arrows point towards the circle, labelled” input energy”.
](./img/fig20.jpg)
[Fig. 20](#fig20) {#fig20}
  
A group of bodies which were in formation before the onset of their fall will produce the same results as a single falling body, with a few exceptions. As shown in test three, when multiple bodies fall as a unit, they group themselves into a spherical formation. Having done this, they will produce the same extracted force as does a single body, shown below.  
  

![a cluster of circles appears in the middle of the diagram. The cluster is arranged in a somewhat round shape. All circles are close together. Pointing outwards from this circle of circles are ovals with one of their edges pointing towards the centre of the circle, and the other edge outwards away from the circle. At the outward edges an arrow points away from the circle.
](./img/fig21.jpg)
[Fig. 21](#fig21) {#fig21}
  
At the same time, each individual body within this formation develops its own rotation, the rate of which depends upon the body's individual size and the velocity of the mass as a whole.  
  

![a circle is drawn. Inside it appear about 11 smaller circles of equal size. Within each of those smaller circles are arrows indicating a counterclockwise motion.](./img/fig22.jpg)
[Fig. 22](#fig22) {#fig22}
  
As seen above, although these bodies combine their energies and rotate as a single body, each individual still obeys the laws of falling bodies as well, and so creates and maintains its own field, which repulses the fields of the other bodies. This repulsive action results in "space" between the bodies. It should also be noted that such a grouping of bodies falling in tight formation will continuously exchange pole positions, i.e., the north pole becomes the south pole and vice versa.  
  
Stated in simple terms, a falling body is an energy exchanger, or in other words, is a transducer. The energy extracted at the leading edge of the fall is consistently the same value - the same sized bubble. Even so, the poles will accept any energy which may be available, be it neutral energy (bubbles) or polarized energy. The interior of a falling body is quite comparable to a variable resistor. The value of resistance is inversely proportional to the velocity of the body at the rate of velocity squared. To repeat: resistance goes down as the velocity is increased. This is illustrated in figure 23.  
  
R ∝ 1/V2
![diagram label on the left: “A falling body is a transducer”. Label on the right: “variable resistance is controlled by velocity”.
A circle is shown. At the 90 and 270 marks arrows point outwards. At the 0 and 180 degrees arrows point in towards the circle. In the centre of the circle is a rheostat symbol.](./img/fig23.jpg)
[Fig. 23](#fig23) {#fig23}
  
## [ENERGY TO MASS CONVERSION](#energy-to-mass-conversion) {#energy-to-mass-conversion}
  
As indicated, a falling body is a transducer and all bodies are falling. Every body has a value of internal resistance which is inversely proportional to velocity. When a body obtains a velocity of .9 times the speed of light, the internal resistance becomes a negligible factor. The body now accepts greater amounts of energy than it can radiate. This surplus energy now becomes very compact, and the minute bubbles of energy begin to pack together, as shown in figure 24.  
  

![a cluster of about 30 small circles is drawn, grouped together forming no particular pattern. Arrows point inwards towards the cluster from all sides around it.](./img/fig24.jpg)
[Fig. 24](#fig24) {#fig24}
  
As a result of this compression of bubbles, a particle of mass is formed. Mass is therefore no more than solidified energy. The compression of bubbles illustrated in figure 24 results in a particle, shown below.  
  

![Arrows point inwards towards a central area. In the centre is a thickly drawn circle.](./img/fig25.jpg)
[Fig. 25](#fig25) {#fig25}
  
Should a falling body maintain a velocity of between 167,000 and 186,000 miles per second, the conversion from energy to mass would be infinite.  
  
## [MASS TO ENERGY CONVERSION](#mass-to-energy-conversion) {#mass-to-energy-conversion}
  
As a body obtains the velocity of light, the internal resistance becomes zero. Energy continues to be extracted from the body at an accelerated rate. The velocity of the body is equal to, or greater than the velocity of energy. This means energy cannot overtake (or "catch up with") and enter the body. The great pressure (potential) extracts all the energy from the body. The sub-atomic particles begin to "shed" their outermost shells (i.e., bubbles), and this process will continue until no particle remains. All that does remain is a vortex of pure (neutral) energy. The conversion of mass to energy is progressive at the rate of the velocity of light squared.  
  
### [DENSITY OF MASS](#density-of-mass) {#density-of-mass}
  
The density of a given element is directly related to the motion of that mass. A falling body is a transducer, the energy exchange of that transducer is limited by the internal resistance of that body. The value of that resistance is inversely proportional to the velocity of the body. Therefore, as the velocity of motion decreases, the internal resistance __increases__, and results in a zero value of energy flow. The body now becomes dormant and lies completely condensed - there exists no space, and no life. The force that will give this body life is motion. Should our entire solar system obtain a velocity of zero, it would probably fit into a quart jar.  
  
### [SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES](#sub-atomic-particles) {#sub-atomic-particles}
  
Minute bubbles of energy, which we call neutral energy, are the building blocks of solid particles. As long as this energy (bubbles) remains at or above the velocity of light, the bubbles remain unattached and independent, however, when the leading edge begins to slow, the trailing bubbles begin to collide with the slowed bubbles. This causes the bubbles to pile up and compact, i.e., some bubbles encase other bubbles, as illustrated in figure 26.  
  

![a series of same-size circles are drawn from left to right. Near the left they are evenly spaced, not touching each other. Above them a label is shown: “above the speed of light”.
As the drawn circles progress toward the right the closer they are drawn to each other,. At some point they start touching each other. Then they start overlapping. Above these circles a label appears: “below the speed of light” .At the far right a fully  filled-in, black, circle is shown, with a label “RESULT: a solid particle”.](./img/fig26.jpg)
[Fig. 26](#fig26) {#fig26}
  
We therefore state that mass is but solidified energy. Sub-atomic particles vary greatly in size, but they are all created by nature in the same manner, and with the exception of size, weight, and configuration, they are __identical__. The scientific community speaks of different particles having different charges, but this is a mis-perception, or more precisely, a problem of mis-identification. There are very simple, logical reasons why that which is called an electron has a negative charge, while that which is called a proton has a positive charge, etc., but the explanation is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be discussed in depth in the segment dealing with atomic structure.  
  
## [ANTI-MATTER](#anti-matter) {#anti-matter}
  
The universe in which we exist is falling in a given direction. The velocity of that fall is unknown except for relative motion, however, should the opposite direction be taken, at exactly the same velocity, the true velocity would then be zero. At absolute zero velocity energy becomes a zero factor, so that v = E, thereby, zero velocity equals zero energy. Mass will respond in a like manner - once again, velocity determines the value of energy contained in mass. With a zero value of energy, mass becomes very condensed.  
  
We will now add value to the zero velocity and say that our motion is now in the reciprocal direction. With an increase in velocity, energy is once more generated. Energy (due to motion) is now available, and the dense, compacted particles expand. The bodies are once again transducers, however, everything is reversed - energy is now being radiated from the former poles, while the plane of the leading edge of the fall accepts energy. The falling body is now a negative ion, and particles which orbit this falling body are charged in a positive direction. This universe (or galaxy, solar system, atom, etc.) at this point is what we can call anti-matter.  
  
As the velocity increases to and beyond the speed of light, we once again convert the mass to energy, and that energy is neutral - neutral, that is, in respect to itself. All that remains of that mass is a spiraling vortex of pure energy. More will be explained on this subject when we discuss the birth of a universe.  


# [REVIEW OF FALLING BODIES](#review-of-falling-bodies) {#review-of-falling-bodies}
  
As we cross the threshold between falling bodies in general to atomic structure in particular, it is imperative the reader fully understands several major points. As stated in segment two (falling bodies) all bodies are in motion (i.e., falling), and all bodies fall through a given gravitational field. In the case of the Milky Way galaxy, the primary gravitational field is that of our universe. For planet Earth, the primary gravitational field is that of our sun. For our moon, the primary gravitational field through which it falls through is that of planet Earth (and so on). All bodies are attracted to the center of the primary gravitational field through which they fall.  
  
We've also previously explained that as a body falls it "radiates" a force of extracted energy along the leading edge of its fall, which causes the body to rotate in the direction of the extraction. This extracted energy is radiated in the form of bubbles, and the size of the bubble is relative to the size of the body from which it's been extracted. This extracted energy attempts to return to the body it's been extracted from, and in so doing creates the force generically termed gravity. This gravity offers a repulsive force to the gravitational field the body is falling through.  
  
All falling bodies are encased in an elongated shell which may also be seen as a bubble. This bubble represents the outermost reaches of the extracted energy, as illustrated in figure 27.  
  

![ A circle of approx 2 cm diameter, sits within a larger circle of approx 10 cm. Emanating out from the smaller circle is a parade of stretched ovals in a shape somewhat resembling a cloverleaf. The origin point of the procession of ovals is the left edge of the smaller circle. From that origin point (9 o'clock ) ovals go both left and right. The ovals travelling left proceed about 6 cm outwards at which point they split up. Some go upwards, some turn donards. The ones turning gradually upwards then loop back towards the circle, rejoining it at the 12 o'clock region.
The ovals that moved towards the right from the 9 o'clock, move straight across the circle towards the 3 o'clock, proceed outwards away from the smaller circle, to about 6 cm away from it, and also split up: some go up, some downwards. At 6cm the procession of small ovals turns around looping back to the circle to rejoin the circle at the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock mark respectively.
As mentioned, the diagram looks like a four leaf clover.](./img/fig27.jpg)
[Fig. 27](#fig27) {#fig27}
  
As can be seen, a particle or a body existing within that bubble is also a falling body. As shown in figure 28, falling body A produces field A, which attracts (pulls) body B towards body A.  
  

![same as in Fig 27 - a procession of ovals originating from the 9 o'clock on the smaller circle. An arrow points to the smaller circle, labelled “Body A”. Another arrow points at the outer, large circle, labelled “Field A”.
Near the inside of the large circle at the 3 o'clock another small circle is drawn. Approx 1 cm diameter. Inside is a dot, around which we see another four leaf clover pattern in a dotted line around the dot.
](./img/fig28.jpg)
[Fig. 28](#fig28) {#fig28}
  
As this attraction is taking place, the field produced by body B repells the field of body A. The interaction between this attraction and repulsion of fields results in the orbit of body B around body A.  
  
To summarize then: the field which surrounds a falling body takes the form of an elongated bubble, and for any particle or body which exists within, or is forced into this bubble, the area of this bubble becomes its primary gravitational field. A falling body is always attracted to the center of the pirmary gravitational field through which it falls. At the same time, the force of extracted energy produced by the falling body is always repelled from the gravitational field through which it falls. An equilibrium is reached which constitutes an orbit. If the reader can understand these basic concepts, all else can be easily comprehended. Nature is not complex, unless we choose to make it so.  
  
## [ATOMIC STRUCTURE](#atomic-structure) {#atomic-structure}
  
We will begin this discussion of atomic structure by considering what constitutes an electrical charge. If we observed a balanced atom we would find it had no charge, yet if we removed particles (electrons) from that balanced atom it would result in that atom now having a positive charge. If we were instead to add electrons to that balanced atom, it would result in that atom now showing a negative charge. Therefore, an electrical charge (negative or positive) is the result of adding or subtracting particles from an atom. Since all falling bodies follow the same laws of nature (be that body sub­atomic, atomic, universal, or anything in between) It is clear that a __single__ particle cannot carry an electrical charge. When members of the scientific community extract so called particles with the aid of their accelerators and confidently proclaim these "particles" to be either negative, positive, or neutral in value, they have either confused their terminology, or have confused the issue, we're not sure which, but regardless, the fact remains that these charged "particles" are in reality __systems__ of particles. If they weren't, they wouldn't be capable of carrying any charge whatsoever. Basic high school science courses teach that an electron is a very small particle which has a negative charge, but this is incorrect. What is perceived as an electron is actually a system of particles. It is perceived as carrying a negative charge due to its very small size relative to the nucleus it orbits. The bubble of extracted energy which surrounds an electron system is smaller than the bubble generated by the atomic nucleus, and so can be said to be negative in __respect__ to the nucleus.

The same proves true when dealing with "particles" from the nucleus of an atom. For example, scientists "smash" a nucleus and excitedly announce they've found mesons, which are supposedly particles similar to an electron except that they can carry negative, positive, or neutral charges, and are various sizes. Again, what they have found are not single particles, but are systems of particles. To our knowledge, science has yet to identify a single particle, and who could say If anyone would recognize it even if they did find one.
Unity dictates that all bodies and systems follow the same basic rules, and so the arrangement and inner workings of sub­atomic systems can be compared to the falling body of our solar system. Our purpose is always to allow the reader to gain an understanding of physical law, so for the sake of clarity we will draw analogies between sub­atomic systems and our solar system, and will now focus attention on a simple electron system, which is comparable to the planet Mercury.

When looking at Mercury we see its rotation and orbit are very fast compared to the more distant planets. Orbiting Mercury are small chunks of debris which are too small to be classified as moons per se, however, they perform the same function and serve to balance the system. A simple electron system behaves in much the same way in that its orbit and rotation are faster than more distant electron systems, while its size and the sizes of. its orbiting bodies are also smaller than more distant electron systems. It must be remembered that each system of particles, no matter how simple or complex, produces a force of extracted energy that creates a gravitational field (bubble) which draws all particles (bodies) within its field toward its center. At the same time, the orbiting particles (bodies) generate their own fields (bubbles) which in turn repels the primary gravitational field through which they fall. A simple electron system is illustrated in figure 29.

![diagram of two circles, one within the other. The smaller circle has a diameter of about 1 cm. The outer circle is about 6cm in diameter.  Contained in the larger circle at approx the 11 o'clock and the 5 o'clock position two smaller circles (about 0.5 cm diam.) are drawn respectively. Within each smaller circle is a dot in the middle. Arrows protruding out from these smaller 0.5 cm circles indicate they are travelling counter clockwise. 
The 1 cm, and both DOTS inside the 0.5 cm circles are labelled “Particles”. The outer circle is labelled “Electron”. The 0.5 cm circles and the outer 6cm circle are labelled “Bubbles”.
](./img/fig29.jpg)
[Fig. 29](#fig29) {#fig29}

We could break this simple system down yet further, but at this time It would likely just cause confusion to the reader unnecessarily. For now it is enough to understand that the entire system is a series of bodies all generating their own gravitational fields, which are in turn encompassed by the larger field of the central body (or bodies). The simple electron is stable, has a fast, close orbit around the atomic nucleus, and is relatively small as compared to other electron systems. It should also be noted at this time that the outermost shell of the bubble generated by the central body (which we call a "mew"), will be repulsed from any similar system which would draw near to it. It is this repulsive action which prevents all matter from collapsing in on itself.

A complex electron system could be likened to the planet Jupiter with its many moons. A complex electron system, as shown in figure 30, is slower in both its rotation and its orbit as compared with a simple electron system, and will be found in the outermost orbits of the atom. Regardless of these differences, however, it operates on the same principles of attraction/repulsion as does a simple electron system, or any other system.

![diagram of two circles, one within the other. The smaller circle has a diameter of about 1 cm. The outer circle is about 6cm in diameter. Seven small circles of 0.5 cm diam orbit around the 1 cm circle at varying distances from it. Arrows coming out of all seven circles indicate they are orbiting counter-clockwise. Within each 0.5 cm circle is a dot. These are labelled “Particles”. The outer 6cm circle is labelled “Electron”.
](./img/fig30.jpg)
[Fig. 30](#fig30) {#fig30}

We haven't undertaken to name any of these particles, as it would be a vain exercise. The particles found in an electron system are the same type of bodies found in neutrons and protons, as will be seen in the next section. They differ in size and in their orbits, as do the planets in our solar system, but they all maintain their orbits due to the same Interaction between the attraction/repulsion of their respective gravitational fields.

## [THE NUCLEUS](#the-nucleus) {#the-nucleus)}

In its simplest form the average electron consists of 81 bodies (particles) while the average proton or neutron contains 22,000 bodies (particles). Each proton or neutron contains their own nucleus, and the bodies which orbit this nucleus are systems of particles, ie., complete (but __very__ small) electron systems. In turn, each nucleus of a proton or a neutron also consists of many systems of particles. The systems of the nucleus will become more clear when we begin our discussion of our solar system nucleus, the sun. Since it's very difficult to diagram such a complex system without computer aid, we ask that the reader visualize our solar system as one large proton (or neutron), and let the sun serve as a model for the proton nucleus. Don't let this seeming contradiction confuse you, the proton nucleus is not a single body and neither is the sun, rather, it is a multi bodied system, but more of that later on. Orbiting the proton in the same way as the planets orbit the sun are systems of bodies, some simple as the systems of the minor planets, and some more complex, as are the systems of the major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, etc.). It must be remembered that orbiting around all of the moons of the planets, especially those of the major planets, are chunks of debris which in turn balance each moon into separate balanced systems, and orbiting these chunks of debris are rocks and smaller pieces of debris which in turn balance these mini systems, and so on. This is admittedly a very sketchy description of a proton (neutron), but all of the systems in nature are so very repetitious that there seems to be little point in weighing down this paper and risking boring the reader with constant repetitions. Suffice it to say that if the reader can in their mind visualize systems of particles orbiting larger systems, which in turn orbit yet larger systems (and so on and so on) all orbiting a central nucleus which is but another system of systems, they will have a fair understanding of the structure of the "simple" proton (or neutron). All of these systems exist and are in motion, undetected, within the gravitational field of the proton/neutron.

In continuing the discussion of the sub­atomic realm we would point out that __all__ systems within an atom (and all atoms) display an isotopic effect, however, the instability varies with each system ­ some exhibit a strong isotopic effect while in other systems it is hardly detectable ­ ie., the lack of stability is a matter of degree. The highly isotopic system stabilizes itself by inter­facing with other isotopic systems. It is the jipsee system which once again travels from system to system attempting to create a balance. In extremely unstable systems the jipsee is in constant and rapid interchange, and it is this continuous and rapid movement of the jipsee between other systems which holds the various systems together as a unit. For clarity, always bear in mind that these jipsies can be any size, and so perform their balancing act on every level ­ from the smallest possible sub­atomic system to the galactic level systems.

The sub­atomic/atomic jipsee system has another interesting effect when we consider a true wanderer, ie., a non-aligned system not in orbit around a larger system of bodies. It is a stable system, and could be visualized as an autonomous micro-atom -­ it is truly a free agent. Like all falling bodies it is in motion at a given velocity, and has an energy exchange which determines pole values. When, in its travels it encounters a slower moving system (or group of systems) the interaction between the pole placements of the respective systems, coupled with the interaction of the attractive/repulsive forces of the jipsee system and system x, can and often does affect the degree of tilt experienced by the bodies and/or systems functioning within the jipsee and/or system x. Depending upon the exact circumstances of the encounter (i.e.: the respective sizes, velocities, direction of motion, pole positions, etc., etc.,) the result could range from a mild shock to one or both systems, to a major upheaval of both systems ­ there are literally thousands of possible scenarios . These free agent jipsee systems have their counterpart on the galactic level, so we will explore some of the possible scenarios more fully in the supplement dealing with the workings of the sun and the solar system, which will follow in the near future. In this discussion, however, without the aid of computer graphics, there is little point in attempting to illustrate the "average" encounter at the atomic/sub­atomic level. Indeed, though the many actions of this particular system of particles are fascinating in the vital functions they perform, we included it in this highly condensed paper primarily to introduce the reader to the concept, and because it is important to the discussion of why some elements can be magnetized while others cannot, and why some elements are radio­active.

A brief sketch is all the explanation this paper will allow, but even this should allow the reader to begin to visualize the actions of the jipsee in the sub­atomic world. Once a foundation of logic is established, our elaboration on the subject in a supplement to follow will be more quickly and easily comprehended.

We'll begin with a short explanation of radio­activity, which is not caused by the weak nuclear force, that enigmatic force which no one can seem to define. Rather, it is caused by the actions of the jipsee systems, which in their never ending effort to create balanced systems, actually throw out particles from highly unstable systems. This free agent, the jipsee, moves around the systems of the unstable atom, and repulses unstable systems with such a force that the atom is perceived to be "shedding" its systems. In fact, the actions of the jipsee in this high velocity atom are so energetic that it in effect tosses these systems out of the gravitational field of the atom. Any system or system of systems (atoms) can be made radio­active if their functions and normal balances are disrupted. Once a disruption has occurred, the jipsee systems quickly begin to throw out the chaotic systems, and the atom is now potentially lethal ­ because it is emitting the very same particles and systems which are released through the walls of the containment vessels. For the time being, this abbreviated explanation will have to suffice.

Now we will briefly discuss magnetism, and will consider the element iron. Due to the great strength of the repulsive forces generated by the many systems within an atom of iron, it is unaffected by the jipsee systems, and in fact this is a case where it is the jipsee system only which experiences disruptions and upheavals in the close encounter. Because of this strong repulsive force (the many reasons for which will be explained in detail in the future) and the relatively unique, symmetrical arrangement of the systems contained in all iron atoms, and the resulting symmetry of the atoms themselves, a current passing through the atom will experience an additive effect. The arrangement of some of the systems in a hypothetical atom of iron are illustrated in figure 31.

![Two diagrams: one labelled “Pole position - top view”, the other “Pole position - side view”. 
“Pole position - top view” diagram: is two circles, one within the other. The smaller circle has a diameter of about 1 cm. The outer circle is about 6cm in diameter. Centre circle has “N” written in the middle. Strewn around, outside the smaller circle , but contained within the large circle are 14 smaller circles, of 0.5 cm diam. Each one of the 14 has “N” written on it and an arrow circling it pointing counter-clockwise.
“Pole position - side view” diagram: a series of circles, equally spaced horizontally, all on the same horizontal plane. There are 11 circles, with the middle one being double the size of the other 10. Through all the circles is a line from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock. At the 12 o'clock is written “N”; at the 6 o'clock it says “S”.

In an element such as gold, the repulsive forces of the various systems within the atom are relatively weak (as compared to iron) and so the jipsee systems have a great effect on these systems, and regularly alter their degree of tilt as they encounter these systems in their travels. A hypothetical and greatly simplified atom of gold is illustrated below.

![exactly the same as fig 31, except the “Pole position - top view” diagram now shows some circles with arrows pointing clockwise and bearing “S”. And some have the “N” in the centre and those have counter-clockwise arrows.
Similarly the “Pole position - side view” diagram has some circles showing “N” at 12 o'clock, “S” at 6 o'clock and some circles have “S” at the 12 o'clock and “N” at 6 o'clock.

When a current is introduced to the element iron, all of the systems "flip" over, but as can be seen in figure 31, they will still be arranged symmetrically in respect to each other, and so an additive effect is experienced. When the systems in the element gold "flip", however, they remain, in effect, asymmetrical in respect to the other systems within that atom of gold, and so do not experience the additive effect when current is applied. We could go into very fine details on this subject, but it is the consensus of our research team that this Is not the most vital subject matter at this time. In fact, with the severe problems faced by our planet and its inhabitants today, magnetism seems almost trivial, and so will be expanded on in the future, after the more vital subjects have been fully addressed.


## [SUMMARY](#summary) {#summary)}

Particle physicists detect only the bubble of the electron system
and believe it to be a single particle/ but in fact/ a single complex electron system contains eighty-one single particles/ and so it's easy to see why our modern physicists are in constant and confused disagreement with each other. This confusion among the scientific community is perhaps the most difficult problem we've had to overcome in formulating unity. A classic example of this confusion is the application of the mechanics of quantum physics/ wherein an electron traveling at a velocity beyond the speed of light is seen as a photon of energy and is called a Beta­ray. Other areas of applied theoretical mathematics view the electron as a solid particle. This is confusing because both applications are correct/ but they have attached different names to the same unit. Just trying to sort out this type of jumbled terminology so that we could evaluate their test results was a momentous task, but when we did, it became very clear that they were dealing with the same unit at different velocities. Apply the equation G = MV2 and you will quickly see that an electron system traveling at the velocity of light or beyond becomes what is seen as a photon/ while an electron system traveling at velocities less than that of light becomes what is seen as a solid particle. The unity equation is valid for all bodies/ and it's not complex/ once we recognize that there is much confusion in the current community of scientists. We must rely on the facts/ and forget all of this fancy guesswork before we "guess" our way into oblivion.
